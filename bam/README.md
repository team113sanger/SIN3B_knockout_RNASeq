# Sample BAM Files for Validation

This directory contains the aligned, duplicate marked BAM files for Larissa's **SIN3B** project.  These are necessary for testing what is hapenning to **SIN3B** transcripts after knockdown.

## BAM file extraction

The BAM files are fetched from canapps via the `./2581-get-bam.sh`.

The output BAM files are located in the `./bam` directory.
