# ***SIN3B*** Project Transcript Counts

This directory contains the TPM counts data for Larissa's ***SIN3B*** project.

## HTSeq Data Collation

The transcript counts data are pulled directly from canapps using [sample-tpm](https://gitlab.internal.sanger.ac.uk/DERMATLAS/sample-tpm). This splits the counts and metacounts, writing the counts and metacounts to the `./counts` and `./metacounts` directories respectively. This process uses the sample metadata located in the `./metadata` directory.


## Counts Matrix Collation

Once individual counts data have been generated, the counts matrices are generated by collating the individual samples files. Four summarised files are generated:

| Data Type          | Filename                                       | Source                       |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| raw counts         | `./summarised/2581-feature-count-v103.txt`     | Sample counts `count` column |
| FPKM values        | `./summarised/2581-feature-fpkm-v103.txt`      | Sample counts `fpkm` column  |
| TPM values         | `./summarised/2581-feature-tpm-v103.txt`       | Sample counts `tpm` column   |
| metafeature counts | `./summarised/2581-metafeature-count-v103.txt` | Metacounts `count` column    |

## Generation Script

The process above is performed using the `./scripts/fetch-transcript-counts.sh` bash script.
